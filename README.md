## Description

Python Newsfeed is a social media application built as an implementation of a Python API.  Users can create an account or login, create/edit/delete a post, and comment on/like the posts of other users.  The API was built using Python, MySQL, PyMySQL, SQLAlchemy (ORM), bycrpt (password hashing), Flask and gunicorn.  It was implemented into frontend using Jinja2 for templating.

This Just Tech News application is refactored to use Python instead of Javascript on the backend.
